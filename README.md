# Parti-Chat

A multi-party political Q&A chat application that provides neutral, side-by-side answers from Norwegian political parties based on their official party programs.

## Overview

Parti-Chat allows users to:
- **Select multiple parties** and ask policy questions
- **Get grounded answers** based strictly on party programs (PDFs) 
- **Compare positions** with transparent citations and page references
- **View source material** with direct links to PDF pages
- **Save conversation history** locally or with optional account sync

All responses are in Norwegian BokmÃ¥l and strictly grounded in official party program documents.

## ðŸš¨ Development Note

**The latest commit contains a temporary `as any` type cast fix in `apps/web/src/utils/orpc.ts`. This should be properly fixed by implementing correct ORPC client types or using a shared types package before production deployment.**

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Next.js API, oRPC for type-safe APIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector, Drizzle ORM
- **AI**: OpenRouter (GPT-4o-mini) for RAG-based responses
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Set up PostgreSQL database** and update environment variables:
   ```bash
   # apps/server/.env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
   OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY=your-key
   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret
   ```

3. **Apply database schema**:
   ```bash
   bun run db:push
   ```

4. **Ingest party programs** (place PDFs in `/party-program/`):
   ```bash
   bun run ingest:parties
   ```

5. **Start development servers**:
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

   - Web app: http://localhost:3000
   - API server: http://localhost:3001
